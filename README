lyricd - lyric daemon and client

to install make sure this directory has a mkconfig.  you can bind/symlink
the mkconfig from your inferno installation.  now execute "mk install",
manually copy the lib/template/lyricscgi to your inferno installation
and all should be well.  you also need the package "web", available
from http://www.xs4all.nl/~mechiel/.

documentation is currently missing unfortunately.  it is on my todo list.
in short:
- appl/lib/lyrics.b and module/lyrics.m is the client library to the daemon.
- appl/cmd/lyricd.b is the daemon, and appl/lib/lyricd/*.b are the
  implementations of various sites to search on and take from.
- appl/cmd/lyric.b is a command-line tool for retrieving lyrics.
- appl/cmd/lyricsgi.b is a scgi website front-end.  the templates lives
  in lib/template/lyriscgi/

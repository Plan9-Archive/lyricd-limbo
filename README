# status

has been in use for quite some time.  is still updated to account
for changed html.


# intro

this package contains a lyric serving daemon, a client and a scgi program
to serve as web frontend.


# install & run

to install make sure this directory has a mkconfig.  you can bind/symlink
the mkconfig from your inferno installation.  now execute "mk install",
manually copy the lib/template/lyricscgi to your inferno installation,
create dis/lib/lyricd and all should be well.  you also need the package
"web", available from http://www.ueber.net/code/r/web.

see the manual pages for usage information.

the lyric library, lyrics, is not documented since it is unlikely anyone
will ever write another client.

lyricscgi is also undocumented since there is nothing
to document about it, use it with scgid, available at
http://www.ueber.net/code/r/scgid.

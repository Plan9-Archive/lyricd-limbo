lyricd - lyric daemon and client

to install make sure this directory has a mkconfig.  you can bind/symlink
the mkconfig from your inferno installation.  now execute "mk install",
manually copy the lib/template/lyricscgi to your inferno installation,
create dis/lib/lyricd and all should be well.  you also need the package
"web", available from http://www.xs4all.nl/~mechiel/.

lyricd and lyric, the daemon and client, are documented in their manual pages.

the lyric library, lyrics, is not documented since it is unlikely anyone
will ever write another client.

lyricscgi is also undocumented since there is nothing
to document about it, use it with scgid, available at
http://www.xs4all.nl/~mechiel/inferno/.

retrieve the latest version by:

	hg clone static-http://www.ueber.net/who/mjl/hg/lyricd/
